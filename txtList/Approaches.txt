Approaches
Supervised learning: 
The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs
 the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
Unsupervised learning: 
No labels are given to the learning algorithm, 
Algorithm finds structure in its input. 
Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
Reinforcement learning: 
A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). 
As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
