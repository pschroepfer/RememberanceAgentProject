College Admissions
Selective American universities have become gatekeepers to lucrative industries
8/9 Supreme Court members went to Harvard / Yale
Not the case in other countries like Canada
(U Toronto has 43% acceptance)
Cycle: Prestigious university <-> fewer students
Opinion: Elite universities turning down too many overqualified candidates
Makes meritocratic admissions difficult to impossible
