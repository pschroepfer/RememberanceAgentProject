Failure and Death
When Orpheus reached the surface, he forgot about Hadesâ€™ warning.
He turned back to look at his wife, who was still in the Underworld, and therefore she vanished forever.
Eventually, he was killed by women in Thrace
Two different reasons from different stories
1) He stopped honoring his previous patron, Dionysus, and only honored the sun god Apollo, which offended Dionysus
2) He stopped loving women after his experience in the underworld, which offended the Thracian women
