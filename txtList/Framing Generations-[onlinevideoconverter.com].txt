hello my name is Gregory a bowed and in this first lesson we're going to talk about the history of interactive Computing but before we get into any of the details I want an outline for you a framework they were going to use to tell the difference or distinguish between the various generations of change over time the way this Frameworks going to go is that for each generation I'll point out what the relevant technology was and the trends that led to a an embodiment of what at that time was a computer then I'll step back and talk about The Visionaries whose ideas lead to that canonical technology and then we'll talk a little bit about the default or assumed or even some cases emergent interaction Style by which I mean the relationship between the humans and the Computing technology and in some ways this is indicated by a ratio between how many humans in Iraq act with how many examples are instances of the Computing technology and then I'll talk about initial applications that drove the adoption of this canonical technology and then we're going to see all the way to a supposed future of computational material we're going to do these one at a time
