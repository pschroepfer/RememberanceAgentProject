Aesthetics
Material Sources: 
Miniaturization: By definition, a bonsai is a tree kept small enough to be container-grown while otherwise fostered to have a mature appearance.
Asymmetry: Bonsai aesthetics discourage strict radial or bilateral symmetry in branch and root placement.
Proportion among elements: The most prized proportions mimic those of a full-grown tree as closely as possible. Small trees with large leaves or needles are out of proportion and are avoided, as is a thin trunk with thick branches.
No trace of the artist: The designer's touch must not be apparent to the viewer
Poignancy: Many of the formal rules of bonsai help the grower create a tree that expresses Wabi-sabi, or portrays an aspect of mono no aware.
