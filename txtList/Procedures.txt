Procedures
Preparation for the dive
Standard diving procedures
Water entry procedures , Buddy checks, buoyancy control, Mask and regulator clearing, equalization of pressure, 
Decompression
short, shallow, decompression stop known as a safety stop to further reduce risk before surfacing
Allows gradual adjustment to higher pressure from resurfacing
Post-dive procedures
debriefing where appropriate, and equipment maintenance, and dive log
If a diver is planning on doing multiple dives in a day, they need to know what the depth and duration of previous dives were in order to calculate residual inert gas levels in preparation for the next dive
Emergency procedures
The most urgent underwater emergencies usually involve a compromised breathing gas supply
Divers are trained in procedures for donating and receiving breathing gas from each other in an emergency
