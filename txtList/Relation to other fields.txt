Relation to other fields
Data mining: 
machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data
while data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data 
Optimization: 
Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: 
many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.
Generalization: 
The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.
Statistics
statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns
