Who was he?
Ancient Greek demigod who fought in the Trojan war on the Greek side
Born to the nymph Thetis and the human king Peleus
Invincible from attacks except for on his heel
As a child, his mother dipped him into the River Styx to grant him immortality
She held him by his heel and so that part remained human.
