No exact definition - many different technologies fall under “smart city” umbrella
Deakin and Al Waer list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city:
The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities.
The use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to transform life and working environments within the region.
The embedding of such ICT in government systems.
The territorialisation of practices that brings ICT and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.
