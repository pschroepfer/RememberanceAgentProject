Motivations
Parents involved were rich but not ultra-rich
Singer provided certainty for them - not possible with donations
Social signaling - validation for parenting skills and children’s talent
Doesn’t come with donating to get admitted
Certain universities are extremely selective
Provides benefits in social status instead of education
