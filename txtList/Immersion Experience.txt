Immersion Experience
Display resolution: 
Minimal Angle of Resolution (MAR) refers to the minimum distance between two display pixels
For the general public, resolution is about 30-65 arc-seconds
Given the viewing distance of 1m regular viewers wonâ€™t be able to perceive two pixels as separate if they are less than 0.29 mm apart
Relationship between display and field of view
a regular person has stereopsis of 160 degrees x 135 degrees or 1/6 of the 360-degree FOV. Immersion is quantified with the immersive index by getting the ratio of display viewing area and 1/6 of the 360-degree FOV.
