History
Following World War II, several trends made the Japanese tradition of bonsai increasingly accessible to Western and world audiences. One key trend was the increase in the number, scope, and prominence of bonsai exhibitions
the Kokufu-ten bonsai displays reappeared in 1947 after a four-year cancellation and became annual affairs
In October 1964, a great exhibition was held in Hibya Park by the private Kokufu Bonsai Association, reorganized into the Nippon Bonsai Association, to mark the 1964 Tokyo Olympics
Another key trend was the increase in books on bonsai and related arts, being published for the first time in English and other languages for audiences outside of Japan. 
A third trend was the increasing availability of expert bonsai training, at first only in Japan and then more widely.
