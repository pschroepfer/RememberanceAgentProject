Prometheus Tricks Zeus
Prometheus placed two offering in front of Zeus and asked him to pick one.
One offering was beef hidden inside an oxâ€™s stomach
Displeasing exterior but value inside
The other offering was bones wrapped inside fat
Pleasing exterior but inedible
Zeus chose the second offering, and humanity would sacrifice bones to the gods and keep the meat for themselves
