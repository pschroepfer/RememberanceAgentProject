Revenge of the Sith
Three years into the Clone Wars, Anakin becomes disillusioned with the Jedi Council and begins to have visions of Padmé dying in childbirth. 
Palpatine convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. 
Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and assumes the Sith moniker Darth Vader. 
Palpatine reveals himself as Darth Sidious to the Jedi and orders their extermination while declaring the former Republic an Empire. 
Vader engages in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar which results in Vader getting disfigured and losing both his legs and his left arm, while Padmé dies after giving birth to twins.
