Qualifications

No exact definition - many different technologies fall under “smart city” umbrella
Deakin and Al Waer list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city:
The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities.
The use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to transform life and working environments within the region.
The embedding of such ICT in government systems.
The territorialisation of practices that brings ICT and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.

Features

Smart grids - Energy grids with features like circuit breakers and distribution boards integrating with home control, renewable energy storage, etc.
Real time data collection for safety, traffic, etc.
Bicycle/scooter sharing systems
Providing access to government services through the use of e-access cards or mobile devices

Intelligence

One viewpoint is that a smart-city uses information technology to improve the “intelligence” of the city
Orchestration intelligence: Where cities establish institutions and community-based problem solving and collaborations
Empowerment intelligence: Cities provide open platforms, experimental facilities and smart city infrastructure in order to cluster innovation in certain districts
Instrumentation intelligence: Where city infrastructure is made smart through real-time data collection, with analysis and predictive modelling across city districts.


Examples

Singapore - Contactless payment technologies, 7.5 million+ people using public transport, and currently developing a vehicle-free eco-smart city
Helsinki - Transitioning entire city bus fleet to electric, and reducing emissions by implementing energy-efficiency measures
Zurich - Smart streetlights that dim or brighten according to traffic, and sensors that collect data about traffic, the environment, and more.
