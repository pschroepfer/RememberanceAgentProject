History and Records

Definition: Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. 
Applications: 
entertainment (particularly video games),
 education (such as medical or military training) 
and business (such as virtual meetings)
Term "virtual reality" coined by Jaron Lanier, who in the late 1980s designed some of the first business-grade virtual reality hardware under his firm VPL Research

Concerns and challenges



Health concerns: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices
One in 4,000 people, or .025% may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts
Children: children of 6–18 experience higher levels of presence and immersion than adults 19–65 years of age
Privacy: particularly vulnerable to mass surveillance. 
Sensors may indirectly reveal information about a user's ethnicity, personality traits, fears, emotions, interests, skills, and physical and mental health condition.

Immersion Experience



Display resolution: 
Minimal Angle of Resolution (MAR) refers to the minimum distance between two display pixels
For the general public, resolution is about 30-65 arc-seconds
Given the viewing distance of 1m regular viewers won’t be able to perceive two pixels as separate if they are less than 0.29 mm apart
Relationship between display and field of view
a regular person has stereopsis of 160 degrees x 135 degrees or 1/6 of the 360-degree FOV. Immersion is quantified with the immersive index by getting the ratio of display viewing area and 1/6 of the 360-degree FOV.


Immersion Experience



Image latency and display refresh frequency
the experience is more immersive with higher refresh rates
higher refresh rates require a more powerful graphics processing unit
Most displays have a refresh rate of 60Hz, which adds ~15ms of additional latency.
The number is reduced to less than 7ms at 120Hz or 240Hz.
