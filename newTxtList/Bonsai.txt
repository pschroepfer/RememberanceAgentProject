Intro
a Japanese version of the traditional Chinese art penjing or penzai
Unlike penjing, which produces entirely natural scenery in small pots that mimic the grandiose shapes of real life scenery, the Japanese "bonsai" only attempts to produce small trees that mimic the shape of real life trees
an umbrella term in English, attached to many forms of diminutive potted plants,

History
Following World War II, several trends made the Japanese tradition of bonsai increasingly accessible to Western and world audiences. One key trend was the increase in the number, scope, and prominence of bonsai exhibitions
the Kokufu-ten bonsai displays reappeared in 1947 after a four-year cancellation and became annual affairs
In October 1964, a great exhibition was held in Hibya Park by the private Kokufu Bonsai Association, reorganized into the Nippon Bonsai Association, to mark the 1964 Tokyo Olympics
Another key trend was the increase in books on bonsai and related arts, being published for the first time in English and other languages for audiences outside of Japan. 
A third trend was the increasing availability of expert bonsai training, at first only in Japan and then more widely.

Aesthetics
Material Sources: 
Miniaturization: By definition, a bonsai is a tree kept small enough to be container-grown while otherwise fostered to have a mature appearance.
Asymmetry: Bonsai aesthetics discourage strict radial or bilateral symmetry in branch and root placement.
Proportion among elements: The most prized proportions mimic those of a full-grown tree as closely as possible. Small trees with large leaves or needles are out of proportion and are avoided, as is a thin trunk with thick branches.
No trace of the artist: The designer's touch must not be apparent to the viewer
Poignancy: Many of the formal rules of bonsai help the grower create a tree that expresses Wabi-sabi, or portrays an aspect of mono no aware.
