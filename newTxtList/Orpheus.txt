Orpheus and the Underworld

Descended into the Underworld in search of his dead wife Eurydice
His music could charm the Earth and the Underworld
Hades let him bring his wife back alive if he walked in front of her and didn’t look back until they were both out of the Underworld.

Failure and Death

When Orpheus reached the surface, he forgot about Hades’ warning.
He turned back to look at his wife, who was still in the Underworld, and therefore she vanished forever.
Eventually, he was killed by women in Thrace
Two different reasons from different stories
1) He stopped honoring his previous patron, Dionysus, and only honored the sun god Apollo, which offended Dionysus
2) He stopped loving women after his experience in the underworld, which offended the Thracian women
