General Information

2019 Criminal Conspiracy revealed about wealthy parents paying to illegally influence university admissions
33 parents paid over 25$ million to bribe officials and inflate scores
William Rick Singer organized the scheme
Unethically helped 750 families with admissions

Unethical Actions

Bribing officials to allow students unlimited SAT time.
Organizing impersonators to take tests for students.
Creating fake athletic profiles for students
Bribing coaches to identify applicants as athletes 
Parents spent $200,000 to $6.5 million to do this.

Repercussions

53 people charged for conspiracy
Coaches of athletic teams fired and sentenced
Many parents pleaded guilty, some ongoing sentencing
Community service, fines, low prison time, supervised release

Motivations

Parents involved were rich but not ultra-rich
Singer provided certainty for them - not possible with donations
Social signaling - validation for parenting skills and children’s talent
Doesn’t come with donating to get admitted
Certain universities are extremely selective
Provides benefits in social status instead of education

College Admissions

Selective American universities have become gatekeepers to lucrative industries
8/9 Supreme Court members went to Harvard / Yale
Not the case in other countries like Canada
(U Toronto has 43% acceptance)
Cycle: Prestigious university <-> fewer students
Opinion: Elite universities turning down too many overqualified candidates
Makes meritocratic admissions difficult to impossible
