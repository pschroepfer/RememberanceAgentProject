History and Records

Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.
The 2000s saw the dominance of the so-called "Top Four" clubs. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United finished at the top of the table for bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League.
Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname "The Invincibles" as it became the first club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game, the only time this has ever happened in the Premier League.
After 2009, the "Top Four" became the "Big Six" as Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City became superclubs
