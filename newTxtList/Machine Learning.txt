Intro



Definition: Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data
It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence
Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions
Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision
Useful when it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks

History



The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.
In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt created the perceptron based on Arthur Samuelâ€™s work and a model of brain cells
In the 1970s backpropagation was developed to update a network
By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor
Success for Geoffrey Hinton came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation

Relation to other fields



Data mining: 
machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data
while data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data 
Optimization: 
Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: 
many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.
Generalization: 
The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.
Statistics
statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns


Approaches



Supervised learning: 
The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs
 the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
Unsupervised learning: 
No labels are given to the learning algorithm, 
Algorithm finds structure in its input. 
Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
Reinforcement learning: 
A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). 
As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
