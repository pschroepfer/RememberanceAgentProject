How it started

Nuclear weapons, war in Korea, espionage, differences in ideology
Berlin Wall in 1961, Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962
1958: Explorer 1 designed by Wernher von Braun
Eisenhower signed a public order to create NASA
For the U.S. effort to send a man into space, dubbed Project Mercury, 
NASA engineers designed a smaller, cone-shaped capsule far lighter than Vostok
They tested the craft with chimpanzees and held a final test flight in March 1961 before the Soviets were able to pull ahead with Gagarin’s launch. On May 5, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space (though not in orbit).

Later that May, President John F. Kennedy made the bold, public claim that the U.S. would land a man on the moon before the end of the decade. In February 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth, and by the end of that year, the foundations of NASA’s lunar landing program–dubbed Project Apollo–were in place.

Important Milestones

Apollo missions ran till 1972
December 1968 saw the launch of Apollo 8, the first manned space mission to orbit the moon
Apollo 11: July 1969
Apollo 13: Service module suffered an explosion in the oxygen tank, were able to come all the way back


Effects

By landing on the moon, the United States effectively “won” the space race that had begun with Sputnik’s launch in 1957.
For their part, the Soviets made four failed attempts to launch a lunar landing craft between 1969 and 1972, including a spectacular launch-pad explosion in July 1969. 
 In 1975, the joint Apollo-Soyuz mission sent three U.S. astronauts into space aboard an Apollo spacecraft that docked in orbit with a Soviet-made Soyuz vehicle. When the commanders of the two crafts officially greeted each other, their “handshake in space” served to symbolize the gradual improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations in the late Cold War era.
